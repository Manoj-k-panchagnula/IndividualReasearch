0	Anyone can make up a testimonial.
0	Testimonials are not facts.
0	Dana Farber is considered a center of excellence by the National Cancer Care Network.
0	I just buried a friend who sought alternative treatment first at stage one at that point it was curable.
0	By the time she sought standard treatment it was too late.
0	The time to seek alternative care is after traditional fails.

0	I have been taking Opdivo infusions since mid April.
0	I was tired before I started and tired after.
0	Since I began Opdivo after having had Gamma Knife chemo and a lobectomy it's hard to say what effect Opdivo had on my energy level.
0	I did have pseudoprogression you mentioned (didn't know there was a word for it - thanks!).
0	One new tumor appeared right after starting and was gone completely two weeks later.
0	I am currently am in NED and my oncologist still has me planned out for two more years of Opdivo.
0	The possible side effects have me thinking but when you think about no cancer treatment is without risk.
#	########################################
0	On a side note for a long while I just accepted my fatigue figuring it was better than nausea and pain.
0	But after awhile I started wondering what the point was in surviving if I spent most of my days in bed or on the sofa.
0	I asked my oncologist if she had any solutions and she prescribed Adderol.
0	Have to admit I have mixed feelings about taking a stimulant on a regular basis but not enough to stop enjoying the vertical life.

3	Hello Lisa first off words do not aduically describe the depth of pain and sorry people go through with news like this.
0	my mom died of lung cancer 1 day ago. she was diagnosed 3 months before.
0	she was 61 years of age.
3	I will say this everyone is different be there for mom try and be strong for her.
0	you will find strength.
#	##########################################
0	The life expectancy you read about is based on the experiences of hundreds of thousands of patients and their outcomes charted on a bell curve.
3	There is no way to tell where your mom will come out on that curve.
3	As you explore check out the inspire.com website.
3	While there search for entries by stage4 survivor.
3	He no longer participates there but his entries remain.
0	His stage 4 adenocarcinoma was discovered because he was having cognitive issues.
0	It turned out he had several brain mets with the lung primary.
0	That was 17 years ago and he's still kicking.
#	###########################################
0	In the past year there have been 6 new treatments approved for lung cancer.
0	A couple of them cross the blood brain barrier and can prevent mets from developing or getting larger.
0	The key to treatment is based on the testing of the cancer to learn where the DNA got screwed up.
#	############################################
3	I was diagnosed with StageIV with brain mets last May and the prognosis for your mom maybe be better than you think.
3	"If she only has tumors in her lung and brain this is a fairly rare situation called ""Oligometastastasis""."
0	That's a fancy term for having only one metastasis.
0	Since mine was also in the brain the oncologist wanted to go after that one first as it was affecting my speech balance and other motor functions.
0	We discussed whole brain radiation brain surgery and radiotactic surgery (in my case the brand name was Gamma Knife.) Since the downside of whole brain radiation didn't appeal to me and cutting my head open was well cutting my head open we opted for the Gamma Knife.
0	After the gamma rays cooked the tumor we began platinum based chemo (Carboplatin and Pemetrexed).
0	The lung tumor shrunk to the point that it was ready for surgery.
#	#############################################
0	Again we discussed options.
0	The surgeon initially suggested a wedge resection which would cut out a part of my lung around the tumor.
0	However I personally thought if you're going that far she might as well take out the whole lobe to make sure it was all gone.
0	Plus to a non-doctor like myself it seemed simpler for her to cut along the lobe rather than cut out a wedge.
0	She agreed so that's what we did.
#	#############################################
0	Before and after surgery my wife and I hounded both my general oncologist and the surgeon to do genomic testing on the tumor as last year nivolumab had just been fast-tracked by the FDA for approval.
0	Not that we didn't expect the treatments to work but I always feel better if I have a next step in mind and hope I don't need it.
0	After a couple of months of reminding them they finally sent out a sample for testing.
#	#############################################
0	Then more mets started popping up but still only in my brain.
0	"Did two more rounds of Gamma Knife to get rid of them and my oncologist wanted to ""wait and see"" what happened over the next few months."
0	Well since the brain mets were coming weeks apart we said our goodbyes followed our radiology oncologist to another facility.
#	#############################################
0	We went to the general oncologist armed with a box of files including the hard fought genomic testing results.
0	"The first question she asked was ""why aren't you on Opdivo"" (Bristol-Myers Squbb brand name for nivolumab)."
0	Turns out I was in another rare case where 20% of NSCLC patients have the PDL-1 protein marker that allows Opdivo to do its work.
0	"The PDL-1 ""hides"" the tumors so the immune system ignores them."
0	Opdivo removes the protein hiding the tumors and kicks up your immune system.
#	#############################################
0	Now while the day to day side effects of my twice monthly Opdivo infusions are a piece of cake compared to the traditional chemo I had before it is not without risks so don't think I'm touting it as a miracle.
0	Each of us is different and what cures one person might well kill another.
0	But in my case it is working.
0	Right before I started I noticed a new tumor ouside my lung.
0	The oncologist wanted to leave it alone to see if the Opdivo did anything.
0	It got bitter right after starting Opdivo then disappeared completely in about two weeks.
#	#############################################
0	So back to the main point:  Oligometastasis is a good thing.
0	Offers a remote chance of a cure and a better chance of survival.
0	Just google it and your head will be swimming with medical jargon before you know it.
#	#############################################
0	If your mom's oncologist hasn't heard of it maybe it's time to shop around for another one.
0	In the meantime I'm going on a limb and suggest strongly that you get the primary tumor in her lung genomically tested.
0	She may not have the PDL-1 or PD1 protein but there are some mutations it may have that will widen her treatment options.
#	#############################################
0	I have no idea what the future holds.
0	The first oncologist that saw me in the ER when I was diagnosed told us not to make plans for Christmas last year.
0	Today I am currently in NED and doing my best to stay that way.
#	#############################################
0	Thanks for getting back to me.
0	Sadly I was on the esophageal boards 4 years ago when my dad was diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer.
0	He passed away about 4 months after diagnosis.
0	And here we are again. Hard to comprehend.
0	I had read about Opdivo but we're still just getting the initial treatment plan set up.
0	And I'm waiting to hear what the 2nd opinion (online) from Dana Farber will be (not expecting a different diagnosis just want to make sure the treatment plans are similar).
0	I've been here in NJ with my mom for 9 days now.
0	I'm taking her to radiation tomorrow and then have to head back to Boston.
0	My aunt and cousin will be taking over driving/helping out through Tuesday when her radiation tx ends.
0	It has been so hard to watch my mom go through this but it has also been a blessing to spent this much time with her.
0	I am cherishing every moment.
0	As for chemo even the radiation has been tough for her (making her tired and she also can't drive while on the pain meds.).
0	She is excruciatingly independent and that has been one of the toughest parts for her.
0	With my dad gone it is going to be so difficult for her to go through chemo here while living alone.
0	Right now she says she wants to stay here in NJ for tx but i think she is warming to the idea of coming to Boston as she realizes that she's sick and needs help and can't do it all alone.
#	#############################################
0	My daughter is almost 13 and my son is 9. Unfortunately my in-laws can't help as they are much older and live in Pittsburgh. (This is the time in life I begin to wonder why we ever moved so far from family).
0	This week the kids stayed in extended care at school until 6pm and my husband left work early to get them.
0	I have a wonderful supportive community where I live so I could possibly do this again for a few weeks while she undergoes chemo here.
0	It has been tough on my husband and kids but they know it's been even tougher for my mom. I will keep you posted.
0	Thanks so much for listening.
#	#############################################
3	You appear to be a kind good hearted person willing to go to such lengths to help your mom go through this.
3	In fact your post is the reason I joined this forum today.
3	Your mom  is blessed to have you your husband and your kids.
3	But having you all around her instead of in another state sounds like it would be much better for everyone involved.
3	While she is the one who physically has cancer it affects your family just as profoundly.
3	Yes having cancer can be terrifying and losing a measure of independence is a challenge.
3	But as you pointed out Boston is where your life  support system and family are and you will be more able to help her if you are on solid ground yourself.
3	It's like what the flight attendants tell you before takeoff:  Secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others.
#	#############################################
0	I was diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC last year and in the beginning I thought the cancer was mine.
0	The rest of my family were concerned spectators but hey -  I was the one with cancer.
0	Didn't take long though to see the suffering my family was experiencing and became clear in the first few months that the cancer was all of ours.
0	Their suffering was as difficult for them as mine was for me just a different kind.
0	My kids (10 and 20 at the time) were afraid to lose their dad and my wife was terrified of losing her husband.
0	Cancer is very generous.  Everyone in the family gets their serving of pain.
#	#############################################
3	Glad to hear your mom is warming up to the idea of moving to Boston where your support system could become hers.
#	#############################################
3	You won't be much help to her stressed out about her her treatments and taking care of her at the same time worrying about your family back home.
#	#############################################
0	The fact that her radiation treatments are ending and the chemo hasn't started yet makes this an excellent time for you to take her to Dana Farber for a second opinion.
0	If you take her before chemo and present it as an option to consider and not a decision that has been made that might help with the transition.
0	I wouldn't wait though as switching doctors and medical facilities during ongoing treatment doesn't sound like the best of ideas.
#	#############################################
0	Hi Diana I so hope that you will answer this.
0	My husband--age 56-- has been diagnosed with pancoast tumor in Oct. of 2010.
0	Everything is going against him (horners syndrome above right lung tumor was in spine inoperable).
0	"He has been given the ""big guns"" of high doses of chemo and radiation--- which took his back pain away (thank God!)."
0	A month later he went for a check up and couldn't get a CAT or PET due to inflammation of his larnyx and breathing tube--- they had to get very close to that area with radiation.
0	He has the next appt. for Jan. 5 for a CAT and PET and we will be given the results on Jan. 10th.
0	He was regaining his strength and stamina through minimal exercise but has always (since diagnosis) felt like he was breathing through a straw and has labored swallowing.
0	Maybe this has improved??? But now the last few days he has had quite harsh pain in his upper chest area--- front and back.
0	Naturally we are concerned and anxiously awaiting to get the results of his scans.
0	Please communicate with us as we need to hear of success stories.
0	Thank you Sincerely Bonnie Pearson ---- bpearson57@gmail.com
#	#############################################
0	Yes Alan I did mean Oct. 2011... getting my years mixed up.
0	"I am sorry about your hardship but no matter how many ""extra"" years you get you always want more."
0	We are new in this fight.
0	We were not told what stage this tumor was in but we do know that it was measured at 97 cubic centimeters...
0	Steve has suffered since April 2011 with a very painful upper back with countless trips to the chiro.
0	That was followed with laryngitis in Sept. for 5 weeks before he went to the Dr.
0	It made the dr. sit up straight when he mentioned that he didn't know if it was related to his throat problem but his right eye lid was droopy--- well of course you know what that means.
0	"A few days later we are regular visitors at a hospital with radiation (7 weeks with the ""big guns"") and chemo (1 week and 1 day at the beginning and then again at the end-- again the ""big guns"") after we were told that it was inoperable."
0	For 3 full weeks (over Christmas) he had no pain good appetite and his stamina and strength was going forward slowly but steadily.
0	But throughout during and after the treatment he feels like he is breathing through a straw and swallowing is labored due to the pressure of the tumor on this area and/or the radiation was directed as close to that area as they dared without ruining it.
0	Now that brings us to today.... the last 5 days he has suffered brand new pain in his upper chest area--- front and back and both of his arms and hands.
0	This is terrifying to us as the pain had dominated his right body mostly and now it is in both sides.
0	Tomorrow we go for a CAT and PET and will get told the results on Tues. the 10th.
0	Thank you for any tips or/and encouragement you can give us.
0	We hope that you are enjoying a good quality of life.

3	Hi Bonnie That all sounds really familiar.
0	Mine was upper right and involved spine in T1.
3	I know that no 2 cases are alike but these are pretty close if you ask me.
0	"I did 35 tomo rads and the ""heavy hitter"" chemo too. cisplatin and etopocide."
0	after that 7 weeks I got re-evaluated for surgery.
0	couldn't be done without risking paralasys because of spine and the bone damage.
0	I went to Cyberknife and 6 taxotere treatments.
0	That pretty much did it in.
0	I've been in remission since Jan. 2010.
0	I go for scan in 2 weeks to follow up.
0	I feel confident about staying in remission.
0	There are after effects that still linger.
0	Nueropathy in my right arm is about it though.
3	It's liveable could have been way worse right?
3	I know of a few survivors of this who have many more years than me.
0	The surgery to remove a pancoast tumor is pretty brutal and I'm actually happy not to have gone through it.
0	There are lasting effects from that too.
3	Most of what he's feeling now is probably caused by the radiation and will subside over time.
0	my tumor is reduced to scar tissue and is visible on CT.
0	I would just say to be patient don't expect to recover overnight treatments are invasive and aggressive and mostly successful.
0	You can ask about post treatment physical therapy.
0	I did and it helped alot. Good luck with the scans  I'm sure there will be big improvements.
3	It's a bumpy ride but it gets better.
#	#############################################
0	I had my upper right lobe removed Jan 3 2001.
0	Still have pain but is getting better.
0	Not as tired anymore still out of shape.
0	My doc said it would probably be a year before I'm back to half way normal of course being macho I didn't believe him but I now believe.
0	We had a major trauma to our bodies and to our mental.
0	My biggest problem is for about 4 months I was a couch potato. Have gained 25lbs but mowing the lawn and doing yard work helps.
0	I forgot what it was like to smell the Roses.
3	Take care it's a good pain.
#	#############################################
3	Thanks for answering so quickly.
0	I needed to hear from someone who has gone through this.
0	Did you have anything else done besides the surgery? Any other treatment?
0	I have rib pain and still have some difficulty getting deep breaths.
0	My internist has prescribed an in haler because I do have times of shortness of breath.
#	#############################################
0	Nothing else done since surgery.
0	I found out I had cancer Oct 10 2000.
0	I met with a ogyn & sugeron and listen to what both of them had to say.
0	I initally wanted surgery but went on the internet and search for info.
0	"Sloane- Kettering had a little article about chemo first then surgery survival rates ""appeared"" to thriple."
0	"My ogyn wanted to do chemo so 3 days before surgery I canceled and started chemo for nine weeks. Last chemo Dec 19th surgery ""good way to start the new year"" Jan 3 2001 with rescheduled surgery."
0	Reports after surgery said at time of tumor removal it was dead.
0	I feel chance of cancer spreading due to mestortises (spelling) when lung was opened is little to none.
0	That's my story and personnel feeling I don't know if I made the right decision.
0	If 5 years from now I'm free of cancer then I'll think I'm right but still won't know for sure. How about you.
#	#############################################
3	I was so glad to read that you no longer have pain.
0	I had a massive drain tube inserted during surgery and it was removed a couple of weeks later.
0	I have had pain in my right shoulder blade ever since.
0	Some days are ok but others are living hell.
#	#############################################
0	JannyI had upper left lobectomy 18 mos. ago.
0	Mine was also early detection.
0	I am non small cell adenocarcinoma.
0	I did not need any treatment but every 6 months I get a catscan and xrays.
3	I agree with you that I have never experienced pain like that in my life.
0	I still have flashbacks about the pain altho they are getting farther apart.
0	It's funny cause I can walk and hardly get out of breath but climbing stairs to fast and I have a hard time breathing.
0	Do you have trouble wearing a bra? I cannot wear one cuz it presses on the incision and bothers the nerves from the surgery.
#	#############################################
0	I had upper right lobectomy may 2011. I am 51 stage 3A.
0	At this point I have days when I feel pretty good and then I have days where my back and under breast just squeeze tight.
0	Here is a tip regarding bra wearing buy a bra extender I started out wearing 2 and now I can manage just one.
0	Forget underwire. Anyone out there can help me with this My family has a house in the Catskilles when ever I go my pain from surgery increases.
0	Could altitude have aanything to do with this??
#	#############################################
0	I too had an upper right lobe removed.
0	Still have a good deal of coughing and my lung capacity does not feel normal yet.
0	I seem to have quite a bit of pain around right rib cage.
0	Seems my body is telling me I still need rest.
0	Never been one to nap but I do need a nap mid-afternoon now.
0	Like yours my tumor was caught early so I did not require chemo or radiation.
#	#############################################
0	Hoping springtime will relieve me of this cough.
0	Actually it is not so bad unless I talk.
0	I have two grandchildren (3 & 5) and after a couple of hours with them I crash and burn the following day.
3	Guess our stamina comes back ever so gradually.
#	#############################################
0	Your story caught my eye my husband just underwent an upper right lobectomy in February.
0	He is going back to work tomorrow on his surgeon's advice.
0	I worry it's too early as he too has pain especially in his ribcage where the tubes were.
0	When did you have your lobectomy?
0	His incision is still swelled and  a little red surgeon said it's just inflamation and normal.
0	He too gets tired quicker than he use too.
0	They say it takes a year to heal completely starting to believe it.
#	#############################################
3	I had a left upper lobectomy 18 mos. ago and I feel wonderful today.
3	Give yourself time to heal and be patient.
3	I was a good ten weeks before I felt like a human again.
0	Today I walk 2 miles a day.
0	I guess I was lucky I never had trouble breathing.
0	I get shortwinded climbing stairs and doing physical work.
0	It was a very painful recovery but I tried to walk in the house a little bit each day.
0	During recovery from surgery I felt very lonely a lot of times altho I had a wonderful supportive family and friends.
0	I also experienced depressionanxiety and crying jags.
0	My Doctor put me on antidepressant medicine and it has made a big difference.
3	Also  these feelings are normal. Our bodies have gone thru a major trama undergoing major surgery.
0	The biggest thing I found was to listen to my body.
3	Rest when you are tired cry when you are sad talk when you need to.
3	One day you will feel like a brand new person.
3	Hope This helped you.
3	If you have any more questions I will be glad to talk with you.
0	I am a 59 year old female.

0	"You may wish to start a new post instead of replying to ones that are more than a month or two ""old""."
0	Folks come and go quickly on a board and old posts rarely get checked so you don't get replies to your questions.
#	#############################################
3	I hope you are doing well with your operation.
3	It is normal to take pain meds for about a month after major surgery.
3	If you had VATS surgery you should soon be ready to take over-the-counter meds instead of the prescription stuff.
3	It may take longer if you had conventional surgery.
#	#############################################
0	I am at stage 1a too both for breast cancer and for lung cancer.
0	I met with a pulmonary oncologist once but she said I was too healthy to see her!!
0	I still see my breast oncologist as they have preventitive meds for that I can take.
0	I sure wish there were medical ways to prevent future episodes of lung cancer too.
0	Exercise and good diet is about all I see supported by research as a way to stay out of the operating room.
#	#############################################
0	I just came to this site to possibly get more info on recovery after a lobectomy.
0	I noticed the dates from the posts so I am not sure I am in the right spot.
0	I also read the other person saying maybe would be better to start a new post.
0	I haven't done this before and haven't been on this site for discussion boards either.
0	So being new to this I will keep checking out what is available.
#	#############################################
0	I had upper left lobe removed on 2-28-11 and working on the recovery process.
0	No further treatment for the lung cancer is needed.
0	I had a triple bypass late 1998 and lumpectomy for breast cancer which was in a lymph node also; and breast reduction a year ago.
0	Still taking meds for that after radiation.
#	#############################################
0	This surgery is more painful and I a guess I am just looking for more info on recovery from the surgery.
#	#############################################
0	I was 45 years old when I had my lobectomy in Sept. 2009.
0	I have always been in good shape and I was quite shocked to learn I had a mass the size of Rhode Island in my right lung.
0	The mass was making me very sick and it had just about destroyed my upper right lung so they did a lobectomy.
0	Long story short it was not cancer but a severe infection.
0	I did not have the VATS so I have a big ugly scar but I am OK with that.
#	#############################################
0	The recovery from the surgery took a lot longer than I expected.
0	I was on hydrocodone for about 6 weeks after the surgery and ibuprophen for a few weeks after that.
0	Even now I still have some discomfort here and there but it's not bad.
#	#############################################
0	Do not be surprised if you gasp from time to time.
0	It took at least 3-4 months for the gasping to stop happening frequently meaning several times an hour.
0	It still happens once or twice a day but not every day.
#	#############################################
0	I found it much more comfortable to sleep sitting up.
0	I did this for about 3 months after surgery.
3	If you don't have a bed that raises up like a hospital bed you might want to invest in a good chair-pillow.
#	#############################################
0	Today I am 47 years old and I'm working on getting back in shape.
0	I do my stair stepper almost every day and I take the stairs to my 8th floor office.
3	There is healing from this surgery. It might be slower than you hope but it will come.
#	#############################################
3	If I can answer any more questions I will be happy to do so.
3	All the best to you in your recovery.
#	#############################################
0	Thank you PBJ Austin for the reply.
0	I don't know the term VATS but I have a big ole scar across the left upper back and some drain tube scars (ouch) under my left arm kind of on top of the incisions from the breast cancer.
0	The doctors and others have told me that this is about the most painful surgery you can have so I thought I was prepared enough I thought I would be off the RX pain meds after 2 weeks out of the hospital but I have tried the regular over the counter and it doesn't even dull the pain most of the time.
0	I really don't like having to have my husband do the cooking and things I usually do.
0	He is happy to be of some kind of help so I should just relax and let myself heal in the time it takes.
#	#############################################
0	It does help though to hear from others that have had the same done and how it effected them.
3	I am not in as good of shape or as young as you were when you had your surgery but I have bounced back after my other surgerys pretty quickly.
#	#############################################
3	Well again thank you so much for your reply.
3	I am glad you are doing so well and that you didn't have a hugh mass of cancer. Very fortunate.
0	My lung cancer was caught at a very early stage due to a scheduled CT 6 months after a bad case of pneumonia during last summer as a f-up scan.
0	At that time they saw a new spot that had not been there during the illness in the summer.
0	I was very lucky but it was in a bad spot so they had to take the whole upper left lobe.
0	At the time they were not absolutly sure it was cancer but pretty certain from the Pet Scan.
0	It was but caught very early so I am lung cancer free now.
#	#############################################
0	Well gees too many words. whew wore me out! Thanks Again.
#	#############################################
0	Thank u for your candid post on your experience.
0	I had upper left lobectomy 2/9 and am going thru the same feelings.
0	A little lonely being at home and trying to do activities in the house to keep me active.
0	I am lucky to have friends checking on me ss well ss my 20 and 22 year olds who are home in the evening.
0	I though I'd recooperate sooner but its a slow recovery.
0	I am 53 and was very active before my cancer reoccurence-ugh!
0	And surprised the way it came back but lucky it was found!
#	#############################################
0	My big concern is I have to have my other lung wedged and at that time a liver tumor will be removed so I hope to heal by end of month.
0	I see the liver surgeon March 15.
#	#############################################
0	Anyone other thoughts on healing from this surgery?
#	#############################################
0	I am trying to remain positive but the rib pain sure can hurt.
0	I sm on ibuprofen q/4 hours and take a Norco at night when pain peaks.
#	#############################################
0	I had my right middle lobe removed Dec 3rd and NOT by the VATs procedure so it is a completly diferent recovery..
0	I too thought I was ready to deal with the pain but this knocked me off my feet..
0	I returned to work part-time the middle of feb but was still taking vicoden at night and exhausted by the time I would get home from work..
0	I am 51 years old and in good health and my tumor was found on a routine chest x-ray have been staged 1a but will continue to be followed by an oncologist.
#	#############################################
0	I spent hours on web sites looking at recovery time frames for this surgery and it takes alot longer than most of us were led to believe by our surgeons..
0	I still take extra strength tylenol 3 times a day and don't even get me started on what its like to wear a bra!
3	I do feel better than you do at 6 weeks out but please be patient with yourself continue to do your breathing exercises walk when you can get as much sleep as you can (I take lunesta at night as I feel better in the day if I get a good nights sleep) and it will get better but it is a slooooooow process.
#	#############################################
0	What is the VATS procedure? I haven't read enough apparently and the surgeons office never mentioned it.
0	All I know is I have a large incision on my upper back and holes on the side where the drain tubes.
0	I am sure it is going to take longer than I though for sure.
0	I had a triple bypass when I was 50 and I don't remember it being this bad and was back to work after about 4 weeks.
0	I am 63 now and had surgery for breast cancer early last year with radiation and now this.
0	I think my body is getting a bit tired of being cut on. At least I am now retired and don't have to go back to work like before.

0	But summer is just around the corner and there are grandkids (17) I want to see so the recovery will have to speed it up a bit.
0	I am working on it at least.
#	#############################################
0	VATS is video assisted thoracic surgery.
0	That is how I had my right lower lobe removed.
0	It is more of a laproscopic surgery.
0	I had 2 small incisions (one on lower back and one of right side) about 1 inch and then a larger 3-4 inch incision (on side and rounding under breast) and a drain tube (under breast).
0	I have a total of 4 scars from the surgery with the largest being the 3-4 inch one.
#	#############################################
0	I had surgery 8 weeks ago and I still have minor pain in the incision areas an if i move wrong it hurts.
0	However VATS is a much smaller surgery than an open type like you indicated.
0	I did notice an increase in incision pain since I started chemo.
#	#############################################
0	Hi everyone. I am a 55 year old female and I had the lower lobe of my left lung removed 8 weeks ago.
0	My cancer was also stage 1a ? no chemo or radiation required.
0	Even though I had VATS I am still in a great deal of discomfort.
0	I have a total of 5 incisions ? 4 small and 1 longer one on my side.
0	Surgeons had to remove a portion of one of my ribs in order to get the lobe out.
0	The pain is mostly in the muscles in my back and around my rib cage now ...
0	I feel battered and bruised all around that area. Sleeping is difficult.
0	I went back to work this week but feel like I could use another few weeks off!
#	#############################################
3	I agree with sissylu1 ? it does take a lot longer to recover than our surgeons lead us to believe.
3	I know it is definitely taking a lot longer than I thought it would! I don't think anyone knows until they've been through it which is why this discussion board is so great!
#	#############################################
3	Sounds like we just need to be patient. God bless us all ...
#	#############################################
0	Friends I don't want to contradict any advice your doctors have given you since every case is different.
0	But when I was trying to wean myself off hydrocodone I tried Extra Strength Tylenol and it did nothing for me at all.
0	I called the doc and he said forget Tylenol it won't help. He recommended ibuprophen.
#	#############################################
0	Please ask your doctor which pain reliever is best and do not make any changes on my advice this is simply what I was told.
#	#############################################
3	And don't be discouraged if the pain or breathlessness lasts longer than the surgeon predicted.
3	The same happened to me.
3	Don't push yourself your body will heal when it is ready.
3	And do keep believing that your strength will come back but these things take time.
3	There is life after lobectomy.
#	#############################################
3	Gentle hugs to all who are recovering from this surgery.
#	#############################################
3	You are so right about the bra issue grama17! I also went the tank with a shelf-bra route.
3	"I did find that ""Barely There"" makes a couple of very stretchy bras that work out pretty good when I want just a little extra (but not too much extra) support."
#	#############################################
0	Well not sure you are still on? Came to this site for info.
0	Have not had my surgery yet.
0	Very interesting. I am the kind of person who wants to know what might lay ahead of me! I want to be pre-pared I know I will want things to move along quickly as far as recuperating.
0	I have a goal! We have plans for a trip to Hawaii the end of Oct. 
0	Which will be just 3months out from surgery.
0	Won't know if any of my lung will actually have to be removed or how much if that? So what can I expect? Should we cancel our plans?
#	#############################################
0	My husband actually had 2 surgeries- a right upper lobectomoy jan. 2011 and then a lower left lobectomoy March 25th and then a second surgery April 8th to repair a leak that had occurred as a complication from surgery- was in the hospital a total of 3 weeks.
0	A collapsed lung May 4th. BUT on July 1st we boarded a plane and went to Mexico for 2 weeks.
3	No problems with his breathing on the flight there and back. Keep your plans!
#	#############################################
3	I am exactly the same way and I do not like surprises...
0	anyway I had the middle lobe of my right lung removed the old fashioned way on Dec 3 2010 and I asked a ton of questions about how long I would be off pain level etc...
0	"what you will keep hearing is ""it's different for everyone"" which is not the answer I wanted to hear."
0	My second child was graduating in June of 2011 and we wanted to go to Hollywood CA for a graduation trip...
3	me being the pre planner that I am I already wanted things in place..
3	then I started to panic that I would not be up for the trip or that I would not be able to keep up with her.
#	#############################################
3	We just got back the beg of July and had a wonderful time..
0	now keep in mind that is 6 months out but I really started to feel back to my old self by May..
3	having a goal is a good thing to strive for..
3	you might not be able to do EVERYTHING that you wanted but you can still have a wonderful trip..ps I did buy the trip insurance just in case.
#	#############################################
3	Everyone's case is different..
3	the VATS is a shorter recovery time..
0	I had my surgery the traditional way..
0	if I were you I would plan on being off for a month-if you have VATS that may be a reasonable time period to plan for if you wind up going back to work sooner than that you could do so...
3	I know how hard it is to plan with this kind of thing but plan for longer than expected so you don't have the anxiety of a deadline date to return to work and let others help you when you get home!!!!!!!
3	Please keep us posted.

0	In late 2012 through a miraculous fluke it was discovered that I have a very large (46mm) aneurysm at the aortic root.
0	In the MRI scans they did to evaluate it some small nodules were spotted in my lung.
0	After a followup CT scan and a biopsy lung cancer was confirmed.
0	In Feb. 2013 I had surgery to remove one lobe of my lung.
0	Due to the very early stage of development I did not have to have either chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
3	Long term prognosis is excellent.
0	I get annual CT scans but the surgeon says the likelyhood of recurrance is very low.
#	#############################################
0	Initially I was thankful that my cancer had been detected so early and that I did not have to have followup treatment.
0	I hapilly participated in Relay for Life events.
0	However I am now embarassed to claim survivorship.
3	Everyone I know who has had cancer have had to endure not only surgery but extensive and debilitating followup treatment.
0	I was fortunate to only had to have surgery.
0	"I get the feeling that I do not qualify as a ""real survivor"" since I did not ""suffer enough"" while getting the followup treatment."
0	So now I don't even mention I am a cancer survivior unless necessary.
#	#############################################
3	I am only a caregiver but the way I see it - you still survived it.
3	Your battle looked different sure but that does not matter. Not to me.
0	I think it is awesome that they caught it so early and you were able to be rid of this beast with surgery alone.
0	Congrats are in order! How much pain and agony you and your family were saved from!
3	Personally I think you have a bit of survivor's guilt.
3	Please do not beat yourself up about this.
3	Take this blessing and live your life to the fullest.
3	Take nothing for granted. Live laugh love.
3	That's how you pay this back. Many your health continue and happiness surround you and yours.

0	I had anal cancer and completed tx on 6-30-2009 and because I was being scanned for follow up a 7mm lung nodule was found in my lower right lobe.
0	Well upon rescan 2 months later it grew to 1.1 cm and had to come out.
0	I had Stage 1a and a lower right lobe lobectomy via vats on 9-23-10.
0	No chemo/rad for the lung.  I had chemo/rad for the anal.
#	#############################################
0	I am a survior and a very lucky one at that.
0	Often times lung cancer isn't detected until a later stage.
#	#############################################
0	I consider myself a survivor of lung cancer.
0	I too was diagnosed before stage 1 and left lower lobe was removed via VATS.  No chemo no radiation.
0	I just considered that a plus to my blessing to be cancer free and survivor.
3	Please do not think because we did not suffer as others do (I had a sister that suffered and did not make it) that we are not survivors.
3	Thank God that we got to it in time.
3	Good luck and blessings to you!
#	#############################################
0	I had my left lung removed 11 years ago because I had a carcinoid tumor.
0	I had no followup treatment.
0	I am getting used to using the term cancer but didn't for years.
0	I also feel like I got really lucky to have been able to have surgery and no treatment.
0	I have recently been attending exercise classes for survivors at a local organization.
3	Just today I spent half of the class convincing myself I had the right to be there.
3	I completely understand how you feel.
#	#############################################
0	At age 66 9 months ago I had a VATS lobectomy for stage 1a adenocarcinoma.
0	Upper right lobe was removed.
0	No further treatment needed.
0	They took out 8 nodes all were clear.
0	The surgery pain from the incisions warranted pain meds for about 1.5 months.
0	Mild pain/breast numbness for about 3 months.
0	But I'm still very short of breath.
0	I walk 2 miles 5 x week and do 15 minutes of mild exercises from a workout video (arms stomach squats etc) 3 days x week.
0	I walk slowly and still breathe hard and the same during the exercises.
0	I also have emphesyma.
0	Does anyone know if I may have reached my full breathing recovery?
0	It was improving very slowly for months since the surgery and now 9 months later I feel like it's staying the same for the last month or so.
0	I don't like to walk with friends because talking makes me more breathless.
0	So I walk alone slowly to concentrate on keeping my breathing in control (slowing my pace when I feel my breathlessness increasing too much) so that I don't have to stop during the 2 miles.
0	Also very short of breath when I go upstairs.  Is this normal?
#	#############################################
0	Hi all my husband is getting a sore throat from radiation treatments and his doctor says if it gets to the point where he is having trouble eating they will need to stop the radiation for awhile.
0	Just wondering if you all have found anything that helps with the sore throat so he can get the radiation as long as possible.
0	He is half way through his 3rd week with 4 weeks to go.
#	#############################################
0	"Ask his doctor for a prescription for ""magic mouthwash"" he will know what it is."
0	This may help enough for him to be able to eat.
0	I did not experience anything but the slightest sore throat from my radiation but as soon as I said my throat felt a little sore he gave me the prescription.
0	I took it a couple of times and it really numbed my throat.
3	I hope this helps. Best wishes to both your hubby and you!
#	#############################################
0	I had 35 days of radiation for NSCLC and had the very sore throat after about the 20th session it is from the burnt esophagus.
0	My DR. described as a bad sun burn to the throat this was by far my worse side effect from my cancer treatments.
0	The magic mouth wash does help. Water was like drinking acidfound spring water was best (no floride) ate lots of mash potatoes puddings ice-cream and scrambled eggs worked best for me.
0	Stay away from acidic type foods.
0	I continued with the rads to the end of treatments.
3	It will get better.
3	Best wishes to your husband and you....
3	Not easy but you can beat this..... Dan
#	#############################################
0	I can't get it down without gagging then vomit.
0	If I get any down it only lasts an hour or 2.
0	But I will say my doctor just gave me antibiotics for a yeast I infection in my throat to my stomach.
0	Day 2 not much relief yet.
#	#############################################
0	I've been there (last summer) but was lucky enough to experience the problem only for about the last 1.5-2 weeks of radiation.
0	It was pretty uncomfortable while it lasted (also my most noticeable side effect of 7 weeks of concurrent radiation and chemo).
0	What worked fairly well for me:
#	#############################################
0	Yes get the magic mouthwash.
0	I think it's Maalox with lidocaine or some such mix. It will help.
#	#############################################
0	They will advise taking it with a straw which you need to do in order to deaden your throat and not your mouth.
#	#############################################
0	I discovered pretty quickly to cut the end of the straw that goes into the liquid as short as possible.
0	You want to be delivering the good stuff to your esophagus ASAP and sucking through the full length of the straw takes too much time and effort.
#	#############################################
0	"Eat quickly after ingesting the ""magic"" because the effect will wear off."
#	#############################################
0	Follow the food recommendations as closely as possible (everything at room temperature no acid no abrasives);
0	it will get to the point where even lukewarm water is painful.
0	My docs advised against things like mashed potatos; they stick in one place and are actually fairly abrasive.
0	I found that to be true.
#	#############################################
0	My salvation for the last week was well-done spaghetti with a lot of butter with the occasional serving of thoroughly boiled hot dogs diced up pretty small.
0	Strangely I also had fairly good luck with corn flakes thoroughly soaked in milk.
0	You will want to experiment with smoothies and pudding of various kinds.
#	#############################################
0	You'll have to tough it out to a degree but get into a routine and stick with it.
0	He'll start to feel like a million bucks a couple weeks after the treatment is done.
#	#############################################
3	I am still having a sore throat 5 months after radiation for vocal chord cancer.
0	ENT prescribed antibiotic for 3 weeks saying it could be inflamation due to radiation.
0	Still sore throat next step is CAT scan.
0	Has anyone else had this problem? Also I will get a tickle in my throat and the have a bad coughing spell then usually cough up a clear salty mucous.
0	Could this be related to radiation?
#	#############################################
3	I see you issue's are probobly long gone.
0	Maybe you can give me some help.
0	I went through 7 weeks of Chemo and radiationwhich was complete 4 months ago.
0	I had cancer on one of my vocal cordsthey say it's gone now.
0	My problem is my throat is still very sore and talking is a real big issue.
0	I just had a PET scan before Thanksgiving and the ENT surgeon said the cancer is gone but the radiation caused a great deal of swelling which doesn't seem to be getting any better.
0	I can deal with the sore throat but my vocal issue's are really frustrating.
0	They have tried several antibiotics and now Prednisone.
0	I go back to the ENT people this Thursday but really I'm kinda losing faith in these Duke Drs for after affects.
#	#############################################
0	I was dx'd in 2009 with tumor in the eppligotis...7 weeks of radiation..refused chemo..
0	I had a voice until radiation and it damaged one of my vocal cords so I have been left with just a whisper mst of the time once in awhile my voice works but it does not sound like me.
0	and if I use it to long it irritates m throat and I cough.
3	It was frustrating for a long time but after this long I am just glad to be a thriver.
0	It makes things hard at times...phone calls...jobs...lol I asked about options but there is that chance that messing with my throat could wake the sleeping c and I have absolutly no interest in that.
#	#############################################
0	I used to have that happen but it only lasted about the first year after therapy.
0	"It got less and less through the year.y onc prescribed ""Miracle Mouthwash"" that I used daily it was awesome and I always used it prior to eating it made life so much better and I had a standing prescription for it for the first year after therapy."
#	#############################################
3	Find out who manufactured equipment being used.
0	Varian was sued for millions for over radiating patients as equipment was not working properly.
0	Also make sure Dr is not over radiating patient.
#	#############################################
0	Try adding honey to your daily routine.
0	It is an anti oxidant that has been used to treat burns for millennium.
0	You do not need to buy the 'medical grade' Manuka honey.
0	Any honey is good but the darker the honey the more antioxidants healing and soothing power.
0	Raw honey may contain botulins so use a processed honey.
0	Have a heaping spoonful 15-30 minutes before radiation and again about15 minutes after.
#	#############################################
3	I also found eating scrambled eggs easy.
3	Try soups with cream. Cream of chicken cream of mushroom etc.  they help add weight.
0	Make milk shakes with Boost or Ensure.
3	My favorite daily treat during chemo and radiation was a  hot fudge sundae sometimes I added a banana.

0	If you are considering Oasis of Hope hospital my advice to you is too go at your own risk.
#	#############################################
0	My brother who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer went there with high hopes and good spirits.
#	#############################################
0	While there he encountered a language barrier problem and a delayed response for pain medication which was finally administered after he paid an extra charge.
#	#############################################
0	He arrived home with no particular instructions as to his care- We admitted him because of his condition the next day to our hospital in California and as I've stated before he died 4 days later.
#	#############################################
0	After a certified letter 3 Emails and numerous phone calls to Oasis I have received no response at all to my questions not even a condolence card or letter.
#	#############################################
0	Please note that the answer to my brother?s original inquires about Oasis were answered within 24 hours with a phone call from the staff.
#	#############################################
0	Ultimately it seems that money takes precedence over the care and responsibility due the patients at Oasis.
#	#############################################
0	I feel that Dr. Contreras and his staff have acted in a very unprofessional manner and lack the common courtesy which should be expected from a Doctor and his staff!
#	#############################################
0	The following certified letter was sent to Dr. Contreras following the death of my brother three days after returning from Oasis Hospital.
#	#############################################
0	In the following months many phone calls to the doctor?s assistants took place.
0	After being assured that his case was being evaluated we still have received no response from either him or my brother?s doctors.
#	#############################################
3	Please read this letter before making any decision to seek treatment at Oasis of Hope Hospital.

0	We just have the lung cancer dx ..no stage but its in the lymp nodes in the center of the chest and possibly by the face.
0	He is 73 and has a heart issues (high blood pressure and a couple of heart attacks).
0	While I am very aware that every journey is different ( I am St 4 colon NED for almost 7 yrs ) can any one give me a heads up on whats coming for him.
0	When my mom passed in 89 of st 4 lung cancer it was 2 1/2 months from dx to passing.
0	I need to know there is some more hope than it was in 89.
#	#############################################
3	Things have improved immeasurably since 1989.
0	In the last 1.5 years we've seen seven new targeted therapies and precision therapies receive approval.
0	The drug Keytruda that helped Jimmy Carter so much for his a stage 4 melanoma with mets to brain has recently been approved for first line treatment in lung cancer.
#	#############################################
3	Unfortunately I have experienced this with my brother.
0	By the time he was diagnosed the lung cancer spread everywhere nothing could be done.
0	He didn't want to believe it and tried to find Drs. Who would treat him. No one would except to help manage pain.
0	He died 4 months after diagnosis.
3	I know what you are dealing with and I am sorry you have to go through it.

0	If your mom has a mutation that has a targeted medication for it she may respond well to treatment.

0	Hi I had surgury Oct 30th 2015 on lower left lobectomy.
0	I did not have to have radiation or chemo.
0	It was smaller than a stage one cancer.
3	I thank God for that and appreciate all the prayers.
0	I do however have a situation that I would like to see if anyone has been thru before.
0	It seems that the vegas nerve was damaged and the diaphragm for the left side is paralized.
0	I cannot walk and talk at the same time.
0	I get out of breath and cannot exert myself.
0	I have trouble with normal everyday things.
0	The surgeon wanted to see if it would improve so I have been dealing with this for 1 year.
0	"The surgeon now says that they can go back in and do a surgery to ""shorten"" the diaphragm to see if that would aleiviate the problem."
0	I would like to know if anyone has had this proceedure and if it helped.
0	I think it is called diaphragm plication.
0	Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks and wellness to all.

0	Chemo/radiation/surgery and other evidence-based treatments have proven that one can fight with cancer.
0	There are few documentaries on cannabis oil which have proven to be effective for cancer patients.
0	It is full of nutrition and found to be effective and reduce side effects and helps to recover fast.

3	Talk to your dr about a pain patch.
3	I was on a similar pain management program.
0	My primary car dr put me on the Fentanyl patch and I very rarely have to use anything for breakthrough pain.
3	I was able to start getting exercise.
0	Through exercise I was able to reduce my patch strength to 12mcg. The patch stays on for three days.
0	Its much easier on the system and it worked better for me than oxycodone.
#	#############################################
0	Had a CT in March and they found nodules in both of my lungs 3mm - 8mm.
0	Follow up scan in June 72 days later the nodules had double in size with the 8mm staying the same.
0	Family Dr wants to wait 6 months and see if the nodules grow anymore??????
0	I know they are small but they doubled in 72 days.
#	#############################################
3	Get an oncologist and another doctor.
3	Would he wait? NO@! I dont want to scare you but dont think all doctors give you the correct advice.
3	I made that mistake and now im stage IV when I could have been stage 1 or 2 if I would have questioned the doctors the first time.
0	Get a second and 3rd opinion if your still not satisfied.
3	I learned the hard way dont make the same mistake.
#	#############################################
0	"Definitely don't wait!  Fortunately my primary doc kept pushing for the next step.  It was first a ""spot"" on lung."
0	She then ordered a CT and it showed it was a 11mm nodule.
0	She then ordered a PET scan.
0	Even though that showed no activity she then ordered a bioposy.
0	The doc doing biopsy could get only one sample from nodule because it was pretty small and that sample came back negative.
0	"Even though that came back negative she called me and said that she was going to the next step and send me to a thoracic surgeon to ""make sure""."
0	I went in to see him and he immediately said he was 99% sure it was cancer.
0	I was in surgery the next week had my follow up just a few days ago and confirmed it was cancer!  Very low grade very slow growing.
0	I am one of the lucky ones; I'm cancer free now but still need my follow up CTs every 6 months for two years and then one a year after that util the 5 year mark.
0	BUt if my primary care doc wouldn't have pushed for each step who knows what would have happened.
3	I owe her a huge thank you.  DONE'T WAIT!!!!!!
#	#############################################
0	Until a nodule has achieved 1 cm (10 mm) It is too small to biopsy.
0	It is likely to yield a false negative.
0	As you may have noticed the OP mentioned that the surgeon was not able to get an adequate sample when he biopsied the 11mm one.
0	There was not enough genetic material to test for modifications.
#	#############################################
3	My wife also has stage 4...lung cancer and it is hardest not having any control of the situation everyting is out of my hands...but most importantly it is in the Lords hands.
#	#############################################
0	Being here in Florida....and if you are going to be stantioned here maybe you can get your Father to come here....we have two excellent hospitals here.....Florida hospital is in my opinion a life saver....and Moffet...which I know little about but hear it too is an excellent option.
3	"Stories I have heard since my wife discovered her cancer is.....""people have lifed several years with Cancer""...treatment has come a long way so there is hope."
#	#############################################
3	I hope you are better.
0	I was just told today this is more than likely in my near future.
0	I am 50 active and independent and want to stay that way.
0	Let me know how it's going now.
#	#############################################
0	I have had a lower right lobe lobectomy with the vats procedure for stage 1a NOMO lung cancer.
0	I was in the hospital 3 days and back to work in a month.
#	#############################################
3	I am so happy to hear that.
3	I am so nervous.
0	Did you have a lot of pain?
0	How was your recovery at home?
3	I really appreciate hearing from you.
#	#############################################
0	Are you having vats?  I had controllable pain for 6 months I only took pain meds the 1st week home.
0	I would try to walk around the house and eventually for walks in the neighborhood.
0	I also did breathing exercises.
0	I was 51 when I had my surgery.
3	Ask me anything you want as I know its scary to go through.
0	The best part is finding it so early at the curable stage.
#	#############################################
0	The type of treatment can really vary.
0	It would also be helpful to know what type of lung cancer and what stage.
#	#############################################
0	I can tell you my husband had squamous stage 3b and had 3 rounds of chemo over about 4 weeks.
0	He tolerated it very well. He was not working due to another health condition.
0	But I can tell you although he did not vomit he was tired and it was acculumative and also right after the treatment he was a little...well drunk like.
0	So even if he did not have the other condition he would not have been able to work anyway.
0	He was on cisplatin and etoposide by the way.
#	#############################################
3	I know that is not much of an answer but  am sure others will ad their stories.
3	Again if you can tell us a bit more it will help.
#	#############################################
0	Oh and remember to drink LOTS of water!
#	#############################################
3	So sorry to know you have to go through the worst.
0	Chemo sucks but it seems to be working for a long time now. 
0	After chemotherapy my father had so many side effects like headache body pain and vomiting.
0	These all are common side-effects after chemo.
0	He started using hemp oil after his treatment which helped him recover fast and in next few weeks realized that any pain he may have had is no longer there or not as intense.
0	You can add hemp oil in your daily meal juices or even in salads too when you're out of olive oil.
0	It tastes quite nutty and crispy and google says it is powerhouse of nutrition when it comes to healthy fats.
0	We found Charlotte's web hemp oil effective for my father - no side effects.
3	I suggest you to try some reputed brand who have complete control over their growing and manufacturing process.
3	I wish you health happiness and all good things in your life.
#	#############################################
0	I am so new at this not sure how my message will work.
0	I had stage 4 lung cancer - 8 months of chemo plus radiation.
0	I did work FT and it was like robotic just did what i had to do.
0	I am blessed with a job that allowed for a flexible schedule so it worked.
0	When/If my lung cancer comes back (expected) I do not think I could do this again.
3	It took a lot of my essential energy out forever but thats also OK.
#	#############################################
0	yes I did FT work just cus I need insurance coverage.
0	It was not easy but just what needed to do it.
0	The hard part was months afterwards with fatigue in my situation and a few other changes in my physiology (bowel/chest radiation).
#	#############################################
0	I was 54 when I was diagnosed with this cancer which was in both lungs altho mostly in one lung plus in my lymph nodes in the mid chest.
0	I did not have a good prognosis but it is now 8 years later and my cancer has not returned as of yet.
0	I did the chemo and radiation together and altho I was fairly ill at the time it was well worth the pain.
3	Good luck to you and remember that the mind does wonders!
#	#############################################
0	I am sorry your drs are not helping with the emotional shock of the diagnosis.
0	There is no cancer until the biopsies prove there is cancer.
3	Its irresponsible for the drs to treat you this way and not answer your questions.
3	When I was 1st dx with anal cancer I asked my dr if he would treat his mother with the same protocal as me and he said yes.
0	My lung cancer was found on follow up scans for the anal cancer and I had my lower right lung lobe removed on 9-23-10 and so far so good.
3	I really like what pbier posted that gives a lot of hope for people in the same situation.
0	Just remember pet scans light up everything its sees and inflamation and infection can light up as well.
3	I wish you well and keep us posted.
#	#############################################
0	Yes A second opinion is always a good idea.
3	Please check out the Inspire health web site there are many stage 4 lung cancer patients who post there and have had all the newest treatments.
3	I wish you and your father well.
#	#############################################
0	Next I went to MD Anderson (#1 Cancer center in the U.S.).
0	There I met with Dr. Reza Mehran? I tell you this because I think that he?s a fantastic doctor (and I?m very selective).
0	Dr. Mehran told me that he felt I should not have the surgery that Hopkins prescribed because he felt that I would not survive the procedure.
0	He asked me to at least postpone my surgery to give MD Anderson an opportunity to give me their honest opinion.
0	During those tests he found a nodule away from my esophagus making me Stage IV.
0	The significant of this is that had I had the surgery at Hopkins and survived I would still have esophageal cancer so the surgery would have been for naught.
#	#############################################
0	Dr. Mehran hooked me up with many specialists at MDA.
0	I?m going to end up getting chemotherapy for my cancer starting next Thursday.
0	Hopkins is going to administer the chemo but MDA is going to oversee the treatment.
0	In my opinion Dr. Mehran both saved my life and is giving me a quality of life I would not have had if I had proceeded with the surgery.
#	#############################################
0	What is your doctor saying about the negative PET?
0	That strikes me as odd?I?m not a doctor but I thought a PET was a good indicator of whether or not something was at least metabolically active (which cancer certainly is).
#	#############################################
0	The PET was negative except for the tumor of course pleural effusion and nodules.
0	Pat I didn't realize that a negative PET scan may respresent cancer that's not metobolically active.
0	I'll be sure my parents ask that question.
0	Maybe this is why it's a little less of a dire situation?
#	#############################################
0	Right now the medication he will be taking is Carboplatin and Alimta every three weeks for 9 weeks and then evaluate then.
#	#############################################
0	Also I wanted to ask if anyone here knew of someone who still had surgery even though it was stage IV lung cancer.
#	#############################################
0	I think we will be going for a second opinion just to be sure.
0	But Pat you also mentioned that it's very important to be comfortable with one's doctor.
0	My parents seem like they have connected with theirs so we shall see.
0	The only thing I worry is 9 weeks later it will have spread but I don't want to think about that just yet.
#	#############################################
3	Any other info would be appreciated and thank you all for your words.
0	It's been definitely a tough 3 weeks.
#	#############################################
3	So you are likely ok there.
0	My husband has stage 3b squamous.
0	He was not a candidate for surgery as the tumor was too large and too close to the heart so sorry I can't help you there.
#	#############################################
0	My understanding is MD Anderson is an excellant facility and can probably get him right away.
0	I would be sure to check it out.
#	#############################################
3	Thanks for the help Pat! No worries about confusion.
3	We all want to be sure when we talk about cancer.
#	#############################################
0	But yes the biopsy was actually from the liquid they extracted.
0	Thats why they had it at stage 4 because it had spread to the effusion.
0	Not sure if that's a normal diagnosis.
0	We'll definitely send it for second opinion.
#	#############################################
0	My wife is having a needle biopsy of a 1.6 cm ggo in a week and is totally scared she has lung cancer.
0	Yet the nodules are not solid.
0	They are what are called ground glass opacities  Have any of you have this or does anyone have information about these?
#	#############################################
0	Ground glass nodules usually indicate adenocarcinoma in situ IF it is cancer.
0	You really can't be certain of anything until the biopsy is back.
0	If this is adeno in situ it is an extremely slow growing cancer that doesn't spread outside of the lungs.
#	#############################################
3	personally would not wait that long for appointment.
0	Do u hane any other abnormal signs going on besides the shortness of breath ?
#	#############################################
0	I would get it removed with NO biopsy...Needle biopsies into the mass...it will leak IF it is cancerous & after results come back you will get rushed to chemo.
0	They can remove them and treat it LIKE cancer during surgery then do the tests after removal... If Dr says to let it go for a while...DON'T.
0	Do not play the russian roulette game of What Ifs...For me..any foreign body that grows in me..I like to get it removed BEFORE it becomes something else.
#	#############################################
0	Nodules can appear for a variety of reasons and no they do not always mean cancer however they only way to confirm cancer is to do a biospy.
3	If you have concerns speak to your doctor about the risks.
3	They are the medical professionals.
#	#############################################
0	taking a child into that environment?
3	The chemo and radiation can be very exhausting.
0	Most of the timle we don't have energy for a shower let alone clean house and mop floors.
0	When I was finally strong enough to attempt to empty the dishwasher after treatment it took me an hour to empty it.
#	#############################################
0	This one and the illness are on you. You want to discuss EXTREMELY STUBBORN?
0	How about the child who is so supremely selfish and ignorant that they can't help their parent clean their home at an extremely low time in their life.
#	#############################################
0	I'm not going to be much help but I am goingin for Biopsy #2 on Wednesday.
0	Biopsy #1 was 10 months ago.
0	It was inconclusive.
0	I only have one tumor 9 mm in size now 8 mm in size when first discovered a year ago.
0	They had me watch and wait for six months then gave me a special PET/CT scan to see if they could detect hormonal emissions.
0	I probably do have a rare cancer called neuroendocrine carcinoid which 80 percent of the time secretes these hormones but my tumor is not doing so.
0	I'm pretty sure just because it's so small.
0	So I hope the new biopsy shows something and they will go in and take this whole tumor out and I will be OK. But on the other hand not looking forward to lung surgery so would prefer an absolute negative.
0	"Anything but ""inconclusive"" though."
0	That special scan was PET/CT and it was PET/CT scan #2 although the first one May 4 of last year used a different substance injected into me.
0	That's where they found the lung nodule.
0	I have high calcium in my blood and they were trying to figure out why.
0	They still haven't figured out why it apparently isn't the malfunctioning parathyroid glands 99.9 percent of people with hypercalcemia have.
0	But now they can't figure out what's what with the lung nodule.
0	And this is UCLA supposed to be one of the best cancer treatment facilities in the United States.
0	I'm kind of torn between trying to find if going outside southern California or maybe just to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles I would get a better answer and just letting UCLA eventually figure this out.
0	But I guess I start with Wednesday's biopsy and go from there.
3	I hope your Mom's doctors figure out what's best for her but know that you have a new friend here who doesn't have good answers but understands what your Mom is going through.
#	#############################################
3	I really appreciate your response.
0	Our pulmonologist said the lungs are hard to biopsy. Harder than the brain.
0	So I guess our situations are not unusual.
0	Praying you get definitive benign results!!!!!  Stay in touch!
#	#############################################
0	A PET scan only records metabolic activity and can only suggest that it is suspicious for a malignancy.
0	Only a biopsy can tell if its cancer or not.
0	After 5 years with no progression the presumption SHOULD be that it is a new primary.
3	Please consider having the second biopsy done at an National Cancer Institute designated center of excellence.
#	#############################################
0	I had first biopsy at Johns Hopkins.
0	They said it didn't give them enough information.
0	I had to go back for a second biopsy.
0	As it turned out the first one didn't work because the tumor was so large that they didn't get past all the dead cells.
0	The second biopsy gave them all the information they needed to do surgery.
0	After surgery I did chemo.
0	That was 3 years ago and no sign of recurrence.
0	I'm so glad I followed through even though it was very stressful.
#	#############################################
0	I hope this helps. Good luck to your mom!!
#	#############################################
0	My dad was given 6 months to live when he was initially diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer.
0	It has been 5 years now and he continues to fight the odds.
0	He has been on Tarceva since his diagnosis no chemo or radiation.
0	"He tested ""wild type"" for the egfr mutation."
0	In addition to Tarceva he does a lot of alternative treatments to help boost his immune system and keep a positive attitude.
3	This post is intended to provide HOPE for those who are battling with lung cancer.
#	#############################################
3	Your father must be the inspiration for others who are surviving from this same situation.
#	#############################################
0	where did your dad get treatment.
0	I am on tarceva now waitung first results of ct scan to see if any improvement  stage 4 lung cancer.. also had small tumor on brain had gamma radition knife surgery waiting MRI next week for check on this.
0	I'm fighting for my life alone lost spouse in May 2014 to lung cancer spread to liver bones was to late.
0	I have no family just friends and care givers I am in my early 60's.
0	How did he get through all the side effects. did he take 150mg or 100mgand  how often.
0	what alternative treament is your dad doing.
#	#############################################
3	I am so sorry for your wife?s loss.
3	Please know that you are not alone we are all here to support you in your battle.
0	My dad is in southern California receiving treatment from a local medical group.
0	He has been on Tarceva 150mg for 5 years straight.
0	His cancer has increased very minimally over the years.
0	The side effects of Tarceva have been very mild and tolerable (i.e. skin rashes dry eyes dry nose and upset stomach).
0	He uses special body lotions/creams to help with his rashes and incorporates a lot of holistic treatments including a special diet to boost his immune system.
0	Most importantly he maintains a positive attitude.
3	Please feel free to visit my blog to read more about his alternative treatments.
3	I'll be sending lots of positive energy your way as you await your CT scan and MRI results.
#	#############################################
3	I'm sorry to hear that your mom is going through this.
0	There has been a lot of progress made in the field and things are looking up for cancer patients treatment wise.
0	My dad has been on Tarceva since 2010 (no chemo/no radiation).
0	We attribute his strong immune system to his healthy lifestyle (daily juicing soursop leaf tea alkaline/organic diet and excercise).
3	Please feel free to visit my blog to learn more about his alternative treatments.
#	#############################################
0	My husband described his back pain as a stabbing deep ache that was constant.
0	He had no lung issues just back pain.
0	After doing a bone scan they found mets to his bones including his spine.
0	They discovered the mets before the lung cancer.
0	That explained the pain he was having.
3	I hope this is not your father's case.
#	#############################################
3	So sorry to read that you are having so many problems.
0	First I'd like to verify one thing.
0	Do you have small cell or non small cell?
0	I ask because preventative radiation to the brain is not beneficial in non small cell and does nothing for the patient.
0	In small cell it does prevent the brain mets for many (not 100%).
#	#############################################
0	there are two appetite stimulants that may help you.
0	They are Marinol and Megace.
0	If you live in a state that has medical marijuana you might look into it.
0	A member of my cancer support group has had great success with it when the other two didn't work for her.
0	You should consult someone who knows more than I if you go that route.
0	I think that you want a tincture of something higher in THC than cannabinoids but I haven't used it so I'm not exactly sure.
#	#############################################
0	Gabapentin and Lyrica are two meds your dr can try to help relieve some of the neuropathy.
0	Look into adding a palliative care MD to you team as they have additional training in dealing with the long term side effects of cancer and other chronic diseases.
#	#############################################
0	I am a 5 year survivor of non small cell adenocarcinoma.
3	My friends husband survived 7+ years with small cell limited before dying of other causes earlier this month.
3	There is always hope.
#	#############################################
0	Do talk to your doc about an Rx for either the Megace or Marinol if you need a stimulant insurance will pay for.
0	Honey is a natural source of anti oxidants.
0	It has been used for healing burns for 1000s of years.
0	Know that the darker the honey the greater the content of anti oxidants.
0	If you use honey pick one that has been homogenized as raw honey contains botulins and you are immuno suppressed right now.
0	Some people say using it during radiation helps prevent some of the burn but i did not find out about that till long after my radiation was finished.
3	Hooray on getting tastebuds and appetite back.
0	It sounds as though you are still on steroids from radiation.
3	They made me ravenous.
0	My cousin and I had ice cream therapy every night.
#	#############################################
0	As for me my stage 4 adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in Oct. 2010 so I am a five year 3 month survivor.
0	I've not had any maintenance treatment.
0	Apparently I am a super responder.
0	When I was diagnosed I was told I might live 10-15 months with treatment.
0	There have been long term side effects.
0	I had osteopenia which became osteoporosis after chemo radiation and the steroids.
0	I've also had 10 fractures on 6 of my ribs 2 of which will never heal.
0	I had 4 compression fractures of vertebrae T6-9 three of which they could repair with kyphoplasty.
3	Please have a bone density test at your earliest opportunity.
#	#############################################
0	Exercise has helped me tremendously.
0	In a couple months when irritation from radiation is done insist on a new pulmonary function test to establish a new baseline.
0	Request pulmonary rehab. Also find out if your local YMCA has a Livestrong program.
0	Are you being treated at Mass General?
0	Some of the worlds best thoracic oncologists practice there.
0	There are soany new treatments that have been approved for lung cancer and promising ones in development.
3	Its an exciting time to be a patient doctor or advocate.
#	#############################################
3	Congratulations on being in remission!! It's a strange word many people confuse it's actual definition.
3	You are very well spoken and articulate and speak fondly of work and supportivness of everyone how is your home support system?
3	Mortality it's a strange thought that no one else in the world knows except those that have come too close.
3	Your entire outlook somehow changes the urgency fades things just don't appear exciting anymore.
3	How deep are the colors you see now dont they seem deeper? Slow down and just observe you'll be amazed at what you see.
3	Talk less about things and listen more you'll hear more than the words that are spoken. Look deep into someones eyes not to see but to feel what the other person feels.
3	Are you using alll your senses or just going through the motions of life?
3	You ARE NOT or will never be damaged goods! You are Juli seeing the dark side is easy figuring out how to get back out into the light is harder for some but more fulfilling as you knew previously.
3	"Do you still think your ""war"" is really over."
3	It's actually called LIFE and it's meant to be LIVED forever! Smilin is contagious smile often.

0	I know that it takes about 2 months to get the complete picture and start treatment most everywhere- faster if its small cell.
0	Get a second opinion working now.
0	The Moffet Cancer Center would be the most convenient for you and they are very good.
#	#############################################
3	Thank you so much for your response.
0	Recent MRI showed no sign of swelling or other tumors.
0	We have been told that it is result of radiation.
0	Today he could not figure out how to use the remote on TV.
0	Just at a loss and do not know where to turn.
0	I do not want to think I am not doing everything possible.
0	I need the truth.  What does it mean when doctors say patient is on Pallative Chemo treatment.
0	I can not seem to get a straight answer.
0	I understand that my husband's cancer can not be cured or that surgery is not a possiblity.
0	Will the chemo treatments slow progression of the cancer or what? Side effects of radiation are nearly overwhelming.
#	#############################################
0	At stage 4 all therapy is palliative.
0	That means its done to relieve the pain and prevent the cancer from growing or spreading.
0	Sometimes a patient will have a complete response to treatment and it will destroy all of the tumor and its mets.
3	That's what happened to me.
3	I had been told I could expect 10-15 months with treatment.
3	That was in October '10.
#	#############################################
0	My mom also had problems eating and using technology.
0	This is not rare.
0	My mom had comorbidities which prevented her from having chemo or using Tarceva.
0	She never had a chance to recover from WBR.
0	Talk to her oncologist about an Rx for Marinol or Megace both are appetite enhancers that can help with meals.
#	#############################################
0	The numbers of treatment and dosage is based on results of clinical trials done years ago.
0	As new information comes in they have tweaked it a bit.
0	There are standards of practice the drs must follow.
0	you might want to talk to the radiation oncologist and see if they can reduce the dosage a bit though.
#	#############################################
0	I had right lower lobe removed Sept 16. Have done very well but the other day was so sore couldn't even take a deep breath.
0	My boyfriend said I was moaning in my sleep.
0	Was sore for two days.  Does this occasionally happen?  I was feeling pretty good before this.
#	#############################################
0	For many the pain continues for several months.
0	If the pain is ever accompanied by shortness of breath or elevated heart rate it could be an indication of a pleural effusion.
#	#############################################
0	The confusion may be related to the radiation and steroids.
0	Its been less than two months since treatment ended.
0	There is no reason why you can't get a second opinion.
0	If they agree with the care plan CTCA made you will find more confidence in them.
#	#############################################
0	"You can try some anti-inflamatory medicines or herbs (teas) which to reduce the ""accumulation"" inside... I am not sure whether you will understand me correctly since my mother language is not English and I am using some kind of translation sites."
0	Still I am writing this since my mother has also been diagnosed and had breathing problems.
0	There was a period when she could not talk almost and we did not allow her to.
0	Now she is caughing but still not so so so bad as before.
0	Now we have another problem to beat and that is to provide more oxigen inside her blood.
0	She is making blood tests and the level of oxyden is lower than normal.
3	So now we will try this. I advice your mother to make this blood test to understand the level of oxigenization and then to think about having some oxigen inside. Still we are trying and hoping and praying every day.
#	#############################################
0	At what stage is your mother diagnosed?
0	How has she proceeded up to now?
0	Was she at some surgery or chemotherapy?
0	What food have they advice your mother to eat?
0	Please share also some information as we are fighting every day with the cancer and every kind of information is useful.
#	#############################################
0	If the room humidity is low put a cool moisture vaporized in the parts of the house she frequents the most.

3	Your reluctance to feed him sugar is understandable but studies have shown that they make no difference.
0	Healthy cells need sucrose to remain strong and reproduce.

3	I'm so glad you posted. I went (and am still going through) the exact same thing.

0	I was cosnidered 'cured'.
3	I like you for whatever reason could not and would not believe that.
0	So I put myself through pure hell for 6 months doing research and getting statistics on recurrence.
0	I looked for reassurance everywhere I could find it.
0	I was driving people crazy.
0	I lost so much weight and was treated for post traumatic stress disorder.
0	No sleep and horrible anxiety filled my days and nights.
0	Then it came time for my first scan.
0	I was convinced my cancer had returned and I had actually accepted that.
0	But it didn't. It was a clear scan.
0	I was stunned. I had talked myself into the worst case senerio recurrent lung cancer.
0	So from that day forward I promised myself I would live the next 6 months entirely differently.
0	I don't read any information or dig up statistics on the Internet.
0	I am in therapy still working on my PTSD.
0	Also I must say I had absolutely no support.
0	I was alone before during and after the entire ordeal.
3	That was so hard. You have a wife and be grateful she is there for comfort.
3	I think that this reaction is very normal.
0	The fear.....after all you have just been through a traumatic experience.
3	It does get easier but it is a form of grieving I have learned.
3	Please find some support that deals with trauma.
3	It will help you.

0	one  thing also I was told by a nurse at one of my appointments......
0	The doctors had no right to call me 'cured'.
0	That I was what is called in remission.
0	That's why we have scans every 6 months for the first 2 years.
0	And then if something odd shows up it will be early enough to do something effective about it.
0	I am able to live a little easier and happier for now.
0	It's been 8 months for me.
0	Now I'm building a little anxiety for that second scan this fall.
0	I believe this is all very normal what you are feeling.
0	Talk about it if and as much as you need to.
0	I didn't have that luxury.
0	I cried a lot and that was ok too.
#	#############################################
0	The good news is that they can aim for a cure with surgery at early stages.
0	Most of us scan only hope to be told that we have no evidence of disease or NED.
#	#############################################
0	There are two groups that can offer you support by supplying you with a phone buddy who has approximately the same diagnosis and matches your age.
0	They are LUNGevity.org and Lungcanceralliance.org.
3	At the first LUNGevity Hope Summit I attended in 2013 I met a man who had a 2a diagnosis who was in his 18th year of survivorship.
3	At the National Summit in May I met several 20-25 year survivors including a 25 year stage 4 survivor.
#	#############################################
3	Keep up with your regular health tests!  contact your hospital's oncology social worker to learn of any support groups near you.
3	Look for a Cancer Support Community or Gildas Club near you.
#	#############################################
0	During the course of my 4 yr 9 mo journey with lung cancer I have met (virtually) a 6 yr old who is on her 4th line of treatment for stage 4 lung cancer.
0	There is a special study being initiated into understanding the causes of lung cancer in young people.
0	As you probably already know the average age of onset for this disease is 70.
3	Please consider contacting the Bonnie Addario Lung Cancer Foundation at lungcancerfoundation.org.

0	In October of 2010 I was told I had 10-15 months to live.
0	Both my parents died within a handful of months with their lung cancer diagnosis so I neverER anyone before me who survived this long.
0	Now through workshops I attend I've met stage 4 survivors who have been around more than 25 years.
#	#############################################
0	I didn't have lung removal but they went thru my ribs for a biopsy back in 2001 and it still hurts  full rib cage and into the back.
0	I just think it is healing process and it takes lots of time.
3	You had a major operation.
#	#############################################
0	I had my right lower lobe removed approx. 2.5 years ago.
0	It took about 3 months to get back.
3	I have complete recovery now and am back playing tennis racketball badminton etc.
#	#############################################
0	Just curious though - what type of lung cancer did you have? Mine was bronchoalveolar carcinoma a subset of adenocarcinoma.
0	I have a theory that this type of cancer can be caused by exposure to mold/mycotoxin (toxins produced by mold).
0	Does anyone have BAC and was ever exposed to mold at work or at home?
#	#############################################
0	I had my right lung completely removed in January 2003 so it's been 2.5 years.
0	I'm a 44 year old NSC 3B survivor.
0	Plymouthean is right it's a long slow recovery even though I'm somewhat younger.
0	I think I was mostly healed in about 1.5 years.
0	I still have a lot of numbness and some annoying pain but it gets gradually better.
0	I have quite a long scar and they had to cut through an entire section of muscle on me that they normally don't have to do.
0	As a result my muscle tissue has healed together with other muscles and scar tissue which makes everything feel very tight.
0	Believe it or not I get relief hanging from monkeybars to stretch it out.
0	Anyway I don't have many limitations except for example if I run for more than a minute or 2 or if I climb several flights of stairs I will be out of breath.
3	Good luck and remember a smile and a positive attitude help the healing process tremendously.
0	Oh and you might look into a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
0	I credit them with my success.
0	I still attend twice weekly for monitored excercise.
#	#############################################
0	The recovery process is definitely long and painful.
0	My Pneumonectomy was done on 9/7/04 I'm still numb under my breast and the scar tissue is very painful pain management is definitely the way to go.
0	My doctor wants me to get steroid shots in the scar I'm not to sure about that.
0	There is also sharp pains that I assume are the nerves healing.
0	The scar is very itchy as well.
0	I'm still not able to move my right shoulder blade.
0	Pain beats Cancer every and anyday.
#	#############################################
0	My name is Kelly I had my left lung removed February 24 2015.
3	I would have to say that the pain that you are feeling is normal.
3	They had to break a couple of your ribs to remove the lung and they are a bear to heal.
#	#############################################
0	Not only did they break mine to remove the lung 2 weeks after my surgery I was putting my nebulizer together and I broke 2 MORE.
#	#############################################
3	I find that sleeping with a WEDGE pillow which you can find at Wal-Mart fo about $20.
0	leeping on an incline helps the other lung not to strain.
0	Warm compresses help sometimes also.
#	#############################################
0	I hope you get well soon and if it is really bothering you see your oncologist about medicine.
