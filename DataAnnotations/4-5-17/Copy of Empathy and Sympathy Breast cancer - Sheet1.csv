0,I took Zofran twice a day for three days after chemo and I didn't get sick at all .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,It is expensive but worth it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I had visions of being deathly ill - tiredness was the worst part for me .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,There is alot of support here as you know .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,After the first one it will be better - you will know what to expect!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Herceptin is now only used for metastases in those who are HER2 and Hummb has mets .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Taxol in the beginning was the same way - then after trials it has been added to anyone with one or more lympth nodes involved .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Probably some day that may be the protocol .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Adriamycin is very effective with HER2 as a first line of defense .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,If you don't enter the trial you won't get herceptin .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,If you do you might or might not so there is a bit of an advantage in doing it - especially if you are young .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I never was sick from the chemo .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,There was pre-medication with Zofran and Decadron for anti-nausea and then Zofran for three days after - on time- whether you think you need it or not .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,The way to go is to take the meds just in case because if you get sick it's too late .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,I was soooooo relieved .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,I had pictures similar to those I'm sure you have in your mind .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,But my first was about dinner time and every one was sitting and eating a sandwich and soup etc .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,No one was sick .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I get herceptin once a week through a port a cath .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I took all 8 treatments of chemo by IV dumb idea looking back .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Makes your veins very tender and remember no blood draws IV taking blood pressure etc on side you had lumpectomy .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Makes lymphadema worse .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I think your original question was how did I get the herceptin prescribed for me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,It is used on the market FDA approved for the treatment of bone mets(tumors in the bone) that are HER2 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,My point is if you are HER2 and herceptin is an antibody that kills those tumor cells wouldn't it be smart to start the medication before the tumor spreads?,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I mean goodness gracious if you have a sinus infection you start antibiotics before it becomes pneumonia .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,If you have high blood pressure you treat if before you have a stroke!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,See what I mean but I couldn't get it prescribed BEFORE I had bone mets because it's not yet indicated for 'prophelactic treatment' (treating something before it gets worse) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I know you won't know if you get it or not (double blind study - MD won't even know) but you are guaranteed to get the chemo .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,That's the constant and they aren't testing it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,Make sure I'm right about that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,Best thing I took for nausea was Zofran very expensive!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,If no insurance compazine may work just as well .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,It made my Parkinson's a lot worse otherwise worked just fine .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,Hi Toni: The best advice re expecting to be sick during chemo is to try not to have any preconceived notions of what you expect to happen .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Try to remain positive and let it happen without your being in knots inside .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,I know that's not easy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,If you go in expecting to be very ill then you may unintintionally help that to be the case .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,If you feel that you simply cannot get the pre treatment anxiety under control talk to your doc about it and ask for something which may help .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,NERVES alone can contribute to nausea .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,We've all heard the tales (many from years ago I might add) of chronic vomiting bone weary fatigue that landed women flat in the bed for a week or two all manner of insult and incident .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,DISCOUNT AS MUCH OF THAT AS YOU CAN MUSTER!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,Science works at a steady clip and there are so many new drugs now for nausea that it's just one big blessing really .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I took Anzamet . One pill prior to the infusions and one each day for 3 days following treatments .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,(My ins . Covered it but I believe the cost is approx . $60 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,00 pill) I only threw up when I got a virus in the middle of my treatments .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,The only real problem I developed and it lasted till I finished treatment was an aversion to drinking water!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,Plain water began to just taste terrible to me and so I switched to making homemade lemonade daily .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,Kept a huge pitcher in the fridge at all times .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,It did the trick for me .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I did get a dry mouth sometimes so I rinsed 3 or 4 times each day with baking soda solution .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,It's a great natural moisturizer .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Also I'd get the extra soft toothbrushes to use during treatment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Your pharmacist can order some for you if they're not on the shelf .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,You don't want any nicks or cuts in the mouth and too your mouth will most likely be more sensitive than usual .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,I can tell you that after my first treatment was behind me (and except for the virus which lasted a week) I pretty much went about my business as usual .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,I walked daily resumed Yoga which I'd done years before gardened a bit (veggies growing in pots was a new and fun experience for me . As an avid gardener I wasn't about to give it up that summer and so improvised a way to keep me out of the sun so much but grow my veggies anyway) There are many things you'll be pleasantly surprised by I think .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,If you give it a chance .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,Don't go in expecting a disastrous experience .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,If one anti nausea med isn't doing it for you then you dr . Will try a different one which does work for you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I actually was out in the yard and fiddling with some plants just an hour after I came home from my first treatment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,I felt a bit odd but not sick .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,I'd feel tired on my second day after treatment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,When I got the virus I actually wanted the sky to fall on me there for a few days .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,I couldn't eat drink or much of anything else .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,I just stayed in bed and threw up .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,My dr . Kept me in the hosp . For a day because she was worried about dehydration but my husband figured the whole thing out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,He made oatmeal for me and would give me a spoonfull every few hours round the clock .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,It was the only thing which didn't come right back up .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,It gave me some nourishment and I was able to stay at home until it had run it's course .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,After which time I was fine again .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Just a few things I hope may help you at this time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,Once that first treatment is over you'll feel much differently so try to relax as much as possible . Work at and focus your energies on just that .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,Try to walk into treatment as if you intend to rule the roost and get an easy time of it to boot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,AND TRY NOT TO LISTEN TO TOO MANY HORROR STORIES in the interim .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,Your body is uniquely yours .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,GOOD LUCK AND KEEP THINKING GOOD THOUGHTS .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,

1,Some folks say it is a personal decision but I know if that was me I'd find a way to stay home You are right about the money part .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,It is filthy . If you decide to go back to work perhaps you could keep a bottle of hand sanitizer nearby .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,I found that during chemo i was pretty much wiped out after each tx and then for several days afterward . I realize that everyone is different so you should do what feels comfortable for you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,

1,Foxhilll the decision to work or not work is going to be up to you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,After your first treatment you will be able to see how your body is going to react to the TAC cocktail and whether you are going to completely lose your energy level .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
0,I was one of those fortunate few who took 18 weeks of TAC and probably wouldn't have been able to work while on chemo .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,You should also be getting a Neulesta shot the day following chemo and this will help you to get your blood count back up much faster .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,However as you say money is very dirty to work around and another thing to consider .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,The younger you are the better you will be able to get through the treatment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I was 63 when I started chemo and I know that after the third treatment I contracted walking pneumonia basically just living in my house .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,You never know and everyone reacts differently .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,

1,She is in her early 40's and says that working kept her mind off of what she was going through .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,

1,Be sure and use the creams your oncologist prescribes from day one .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,It will help your skin to stay moist and you want that .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,I used Aquaphor which you can buy in any drug store to keep my skin moist and I used Biafine a prescription when I started getting pink .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,Get lots of rest!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
0,Drink lots of fluids .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,You might want to wear long pants and socks for your treatments .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,It is freezing in that room .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,0,
1,They covered me with a blanket but it was still cold .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,One more . If you use Aquaphor and only use what your own rads oncologist says to be sure and wear something that you can just throw away when you finish rads .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,I wore old tshirts of my hubby's because Aquaphor is really greasy and stains .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,Even hot water can't get the stains out .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
0,I used it mainly at night when I went to bed and greased myself up good . Lol Aquaphor first and Biafine on top of that .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,And you can't put anything like that on your skin for a few hours prior to your treatment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,Be gentle with your skin too when you bathe or shower .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,

1,Chemo is truly amazing .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,"My chemo was AFTER my bilateral mastectomy so I didn't get to really ""see"" it working .",,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,The advice about skin care is right on .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,0,
0,My center showered me with Aquaphor and Biafine .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,I only needed to ask so you may not have to buy any if your center is like mine .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
0,I remember that at first I didn't notice any effects from the radiation .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
1,Don't let that lull you into not being vigilant about slathering the lotions on .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
1,I never got badly burned and I believe it was partially because I greased myself up every four hours or so once my radiation oncologist told me to start using the lotions .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
1,You'll be looking back at this part of your journey before you know it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,And I am so glad the chemo worked so well for you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,

1,Good luck Linda You deserve this good news . Take care Kay,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Linda Take care of yourself and make sure you REST when going through radiation .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,It may not seem like a lot (10-15 minutes of rads each day) but as you have additional treatments you may get tired more quickly .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
1,The effect builds up and as you have more treatments your body works at healing the area of treatment which pulls energy from the rest of you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,1,
1,Like Sue mentioned use the lotion or cream your rads doctor and nurses recommend right from the start .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,It will help reduce skin problems like burning and dryness .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,My advice: take naps whenever you can .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,Take care and keep us posted on how things are going .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Congrats Linda on such a good response .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,My original BC responded really well to chemo too it's exciting when you know your tackling this thing .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Best of luck to you on your rads and take good care of your skin as you go through them .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Radiation was very do-able for me and my skin held up really nice .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,This is great news!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,And I know rads will be a breeze for you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Congratulations on the chemo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Good luck with radiation!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,"They aren't a ""breeze"" but I am sure you will do fine .",,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Such wonderful news .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,

1,so glad the chemo is effective against the cancer .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,I also dod much better in rads and hoping it is the same for you !,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
0,From what i understand that is usual in IBC .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,My first doctor did not do chemo again after the radiation and that is why i ended up in this mess .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,If your doctor does not advise chemo again get a second opinion .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,I had 11 nodes removed and 5 were positive doctor told me that was good but he was so wrong .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,It is better to be safe .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,This is wonderful news!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Linda I am happy to hear the wonderful news!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,Be diligent and cream your skin per your radiologist's instructions .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,

0,In my case my margins were not clear .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,

0,"I had a similar experience except when they did the second ""re-incision"" the pathology report re-classed me as Stage 1B (it had been Stage 0 after the first partial mastectomy--called that because they took more of my breast than expected) .",,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I found that the incision took a bit longer to heal because it had been re-opened but this was easier because they didn't need to take any nodes the second time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Even though I had no node involvement my onc wanted me to do chemo because I had a high-grade tumor (1 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,2 cm) and I am triple negative so there is no hormone treatment that will work for me .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I'm half-way through the 6 chemo treatments with new side-effects each time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,"What a challenge it is to stay positive as new things start to ""appear""--this cycle my feet are burning last cycle I got a rash and the first I had dental issues .",,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,I'm looking forward to radiation (33 treatments) which means that I'll be finished with the chemo!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,Your onc is being thorough and that is a good thing . You really wouldn't have wanted it any other way I mean to go through all of this and not be sure that he got it all would be more upsetting .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,

1,I was fortunate this didn't happen to me . But a close friend had this experience 3 TIMES!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,0,
0,Took three surgeries to get clean margins .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
0,Each time pathology said the margins weren't clear enough . If it's any consolation she said other than being put to sleep 3 times it wasn't bad at all .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,She even played tennis inbetween!,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,0,
0,The surgeon used the same incisions . She also had clean lymph nodes and after her third surgery she was onto radiation in 3 weeks .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,2,
1,I hate this is happening to you but I don't think it's all that uncommon .,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
1,I wish you the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,3,
#,#########################################,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,#,
0,I also had a re-excision .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,Unfortunately on the first lumpectomy I had 10 positive nodes .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,So the second surgery (for clear margins) was actually a piece of cake .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,You'll do great .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,I know it wasn't what you wanted to hear but thank God you had no positive nodes .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,See--there's always something to be grateful for!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
#,##########################################,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,#,

0,I had a left lumpectomy and a right mastectomy five years ago they told me the same thing they didn't get a clear margin .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,Since it was the first operation I had ever had in my life it totally freaked me out and I told them there was no way I could handle another operation .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,Also I am self supporting and was concerned about holding my position at work if I stayed out additional time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I chose the alternate method of doing chemo and radiation which I probably would have had to do even with the second operation .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I have been cancer free for five years however some small specs showed up on my mammogram recently .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,I was called to the surgeon_??S office and told it might be cancer in the very early stages .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I did the biopsy they recommended and the results were negative no cancer .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,The surgeon said I want you to have an operation anyway .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,I didn't know what to think and wondered if this was just a surgeon trying to increase business .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I told him I wanted to talk to my oncologist before making a decision .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,My oncologist went along with the surgeon .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,She said they did not get good samples and some of the calcifications (specs) might be cancerous .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
0,I am scheduled to have them removed on March 23 2011 and I am still not convinced that I have cancer but I am afraid to take a chance so I am taking my doctors advice .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,0,
1,I know you must feel anger as I did but it might be best to have it removed to prevent cancer from returning in the future .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,May God bless you and give you strength through this difficult time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
#,############################################,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,#,
1,It happened to me too .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,I was angry at first too because I thought why didn't they just take more the first time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,Iknow now that this is common figure the microscope shows them more and thank God it did .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,Just part of the fight against the beast .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,God Bless you and keep you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,

0,Then I got the tattoos and I was off for the day .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,My sessions of rads after that only took maybe a couple of minutes .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,

1,I did the dry run tattos etc and shaped the form i laid it & started day or two later .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,Practice holding your arms above your head to get the muscles ready .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,You may be in better shape and maybe you did not have surgery first but every time I went for radiation the muscles under my arms were sore afterward from keeping my arms over my head (mostly on the side they took lymph nodes from) and I was only on the table 20 minutes or so each time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,1,
1,I agree that it sounds like they are trying to be very thourough to be sure they get it right .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
1,Just keep reminding yourself that it is temporary and it is zapping the cancer out of there . Seof,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
1,I had a form fitted pad (not sure of real name)like foam beads in plastic and sucked air out so each time I went in . I would just lay the same exact way each time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,

1,Good luck on your recovery!,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,3,
0,The recliner is the best idea if you have one .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,

0,The best is little neck type or thin pillows to get your arms a little away from your body .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,If you can find some small pillows with the tiny micro beads in them they are really nice . Or some thin tiny pillows Brookstone sometimes have the micro bead ones .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
0,When I had my surgery the only way I could sleep was to sleep on the couch in our family room .,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,2,
