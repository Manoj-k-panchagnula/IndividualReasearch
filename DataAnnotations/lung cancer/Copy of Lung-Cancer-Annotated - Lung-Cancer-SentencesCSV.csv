I'm not going to be much help but I am goingin for Biopsy #2 on Wednesday.,,,,,,,,,,1-Jan,0,0,0,0,2
Biopsy #1 was 10 months ago.,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,2
It was inconclusive.,,,,,,,,,,1-Jan,1,0,2000-10,-1,2
I only have one tumor 9 mm in size now 8 mm in size when first discovered a year ago.,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1
They had me watch and wait for six months then gave me a special PET/CT scan to see if they could detect hormonal emissions.,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,2
I probably do have a rare cancer called neuroendocrine carcinoid which 80 percent of the time secretes these hormones but my tumor is not doing so.,,,,,,,,,,1-Jan,1,0,2000-10,-1,1
I'm pretty sure just because it's so small.,,,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,1
So I hope the new biopsy shows something and they will go in and take this whole tumor out and I will be OK. But on the other hand not looking forward to lung surgery so would prefer an absolute negative.,,,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,2
"Anything but ""inconclusive"" though.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

They still haven't figured out why it apparently isn't the malfunctioning parathyroid glands 99.9 percent of people with hypercalcemia have.,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1
